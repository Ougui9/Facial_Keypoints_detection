# Facial Keypoints Detection implemented with Pytorch

This is a program for dectecting 5 major facial keypoints and can be easily extended to 68 keypoints.  

## Getting Started
1. comment out test section in try.py to train a model and comment out the train section to test a model.
2. run try.py. 

```
python try.py
```
